Each folder has a name MODEL_NAME and contains the following.
- GSMP PRISM model MODEL_NAME.
- Text file of name "Untitled document" with raw output of the following sequence of PRISM GUI operations for model MODEL_NAME:
	- model -> view -> states,
	- model -> view -> transition matrix,
	- model -> view -> state rewards,
	- model -> view -> transition rewards,
	- model -> view -> labels.
- Optionally, some models have their own readme files. For example, one of them has undefined constants, so you can find them there.
